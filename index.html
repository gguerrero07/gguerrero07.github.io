    <p> I am currently a senior at KIPP - I love to play sports, music and be sociable. I have a chronic disease called Senioritis and it is deadly. At this point in the school year i'm not intrested in doing any work - which includes classwork, homework, etc. However, I still pass my tests and quizzes and have a 3.2 GPA average for the year. I want the disease to leave quickly so I can enter Manhattan College in the fall and accomplish my goal of becoming a psychologist. </p>
