    <p> I am currently a senior at KIPP - I love to play sports, music and be sociable. I have a chronic disease called Senioritis and it is deadly. At this point in the school year i'm not intrested in doing any work - which includes classwork, homework, etc. However, I still pass my tests and quizzes and have a 3.2 GPA average for the year. I want the disease to leave quickly so I can enter Manhattan College in the fall and accomplish my goal of becoming a psychologist. </p>

    <p id="description"> I fell in love with learning how the human mind works in highschool while taking an Intro to Psychology course. It's very intriguing to know why people may do the things that they do - with certain disorders that may affect an individuals' homeostasis. During middle school, I was in the rhythm section and fell in love with it and to this day I continue to play for KIPP's orchestra. Although I'm not the best with the drums, it's a different story when it comes to the congas!</p>
